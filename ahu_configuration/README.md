## Purpose

The AHU Configuration tool was created to allow for easy building and editing of JSON files that are fed to the [Volttron application](https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron-applications). The tool enables users to edit key values via drop downs, radio buttons, and sliders. The enforced thresholds and error checking prevents the user from creating an invalid config file for the Volttron application.

## How to run

To run this application, download the repo and run the command `yarn build` which will produce and build folder in the repo's root directory. Navigate to that directory and open the AHUConfigrationTool.html file in your browser of choice.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
